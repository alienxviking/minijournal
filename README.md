## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18.x or higher)
* npm
* MongoDB (local installation or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)

### Local Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/minijournal.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/minijournal.git)
    cd minijournal
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the server directory
    cd server

    # Install dependencies
    npm install

    # Create a .env file in the /server directory
    # and add your variables
    touch .env
    ```
    Your `server/.env` file should look like this:
    ```
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
    ```
    
3.  **Setup the Frontend:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the client directory from the root
    cd client

    # Install dependencies
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the Application:**
    * You can run each part separately from their respective directories (`/client` and `/server`) with `npm run dev` (for client) and `npm start` (for server).
    * Or, from the **root `minijournal` directory**, install `concurrently` to run both with one command:
        ```bash
        npm install concurrently
        # Then add this script to the root package.json:
        # "scripts": {
        #   "dev": "concurrently \"npm run dev --prefix client\" \"npm start --prefix server\""
        # }
        npm run dev
        ```
